## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹


Welcome to my solution for the QR code component coding challenge from Frontend Mentor! In this challenge, the goal was to build a QR code component and make it look as close to the provided design as possible.

Frontend Mentor provides coding challenges that help improve coding skills by building realistic projects. I found this challenge particularly helpful for practicing HTML and CSS.

## Challenge Details
The challenge required creating a QR code component based on the designs provided in the /design folder. The designs included both mobile and desktop versions in JPG format. As the designs were static, I had to make judgment calls on styles such as font-size, padding, and margin.

To tackle this challenge, I followed the suggested process provided in the challenge description:

Initialized the project as a public repository on GitHub.

Structured the content using HTML before adding any styles.

Wrote base styles for the project, including general content styles like font-family and font-size.

Started adding styles from the top of the page and worked down, ensuring completion of each section before moving on to the next.
